    <h3>Houston's</h3>
      <p class="text-block">Houston's, a restaurant chain in South Florida, has my favorite food: a Thai Steak Salad. Growing up, my mom and I would go here and it was always a fun time with a good ambiance and nice lighting. They have good bread-starters as well. If you're looking for a dessert, the five-nut brownie is a great one. </p>  
    <h3>J Alexander's</h3>
      <p class="text-block">I grew up in Boca Raton, and as far as I can remember, J Alexander's has always been there. My favorite food here is the Cypress Salad, with cilantro vinagrette. It comes with cornbread crutons, but I find the regular homemade ones yummier</p>
    <h3>Anzo</h3>
      <p class="text-block">This spot opened within the last two years. They serve lunch/ dinner bowls with a variety of options,and they also offer a dessert/sweeter bowl with one of my favorite foods: açaí. </p>
